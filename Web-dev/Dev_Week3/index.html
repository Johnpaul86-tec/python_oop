            <h2>🎓 The Scholarship</h2>
            <p>Power Learn Academy showed up in my life right when I needed direction. I’d just wrapped up my ICT Technician Level 5 certificate, and honestly—I was stuck. No clear next step, no roadmap. Then one day, scrolling through WhatsApp, I saw a post from one of my peers celebrating their graduation from Power Learn Cohort 5. That moment sparked something. I registered, took a shot... and boom—within a week or two, I was in.</p>
            <p>Since then, it’s felt like I’ve found my tribe. My curiosity in tech finally has a home, and I genuinely believe this is where I’m meant to grow. Power Learn Academy, thank you—not just for accepting me, but for the bigger mission you’re pushing forward for African youth. I’m here for the journey, and I’m ready to grow with you.</p>
